Northeast India is one of the most enchanting regions of the country, renowned for its rich diversity. This area boasts forests, rivers, mountains, a wide variety of flora and fauna, fascinating ethnicities, the stunning Himalayan panorama, rolling terrains, lush tea gardens, exceptional wildlife and bird sanctuaries, mystical temples, vibrant festivals, delightful folk music, and graceful dances. Among the northeastern states, Assam is famous as the land of blue hills, featuring the majestic Brahmaputra and Barak rivers, the one-horned rhinoceros, indigenous crude oil, tea gardens, and other natural resources.

Nestled in the far eastern corner of Assam lies the quaint town of Digboi, celebrated as the birthplace of the Indian oil industry. Surrounded by the Upper Dehing Reserve Forest, Digboi serves as the gateway to the southeastern districts of Arunachal Pradesh.

Located in the Tinsukia district of Assam, Digboi is known for being the origin of India’s oil industry, where crude oil was discovered in the late 19th century. Nicknamed the oil city of Assam, it is the site of the first oil well in Asia, drilled in 1889, and the first refinery, established in 1901.

The town, historically home to numerous British professionals working for Assam Oil Company until after India’s independence, features well-developed infrastructure and unique bungalows. The Digboi Club boasts an eighteen-hole golf course, and the town offers Italian architectural guest houses and tourist apartments to promote tourism in Upper Assam. Initially owned and operated by Assam Oil Company Limited, it is now part of Indian Oil Company Limited, symbolized by the charging red rhino logo.

Just seven years after Edwin L. Drake drilled the world's first oil well in Titusville, Pennsylvania, in 1859, history witnessed another significant oil exploration in Asia. The Bible references the use of oil in ancient Egypt, Persia, India, and Mesopotamia. In the mid-19th century, Scottish chemist Dr. James Young developed a process to produce lamp and heating oil from coal and oil shale, later known as paraffin oil, earning him the nickname “Paraffin Young.” Edwin L. Drake, the first American to successfully drill for oil, initiated a wave of investment and drilling that established petroleum as a major industry, earning him the title of father of the petroleum industry, despite being unable to patent his drilling methods.

In the dense, malaria-infested jungles of Upper Assam, a group of pioneers discovered oil in 1867 while building a railway line for the Assam Railways and Trading Company. The town of Digboi got its name from an English engineer’s repeated instruction to workers, “Dig, boy, dig,” as they drilled for oil.

In 1889, the first well was drilled, marking the start of India's oil industry. By 1901, the Digboi refinery began operating, and by 1902, organized marketing of petroleum products had commenced. At its peak during World War II, the Digboi oil field produced nearly 7,000 barrels of oil per day. Today, production is about 240 barrels per day, making it India’s oldest continuously producing oil field.

The Assam Oil Division has an extensive marketing network with 351 retail outlets, 399 SKO/LDO agencies, and 268 LPG distributorships, supported by terminals in Tinsukia and Lumding. It is expanding into states like West Bengal, Orissa, Bihar, Jharkhand, Haryana, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh, and Punjab.

Digboi, now the headquarters of Assam Oil Division of Indian Oil Company Limited, has a rich history dating back to 1825, with early references to oil found in Upper Assam by several British officers and the Geological Survey of India. In 1866, the first drilling attempt by Mr. Goodenough at Nahorpung proved dry, but success came with the second well at Makum in 1889.

The Digboi refinery, with an initial capacity of 0.5 MMTPA, was modernized and expanded to 0.65 MMTPA in 1996. Several units, including a Catalytic Reformer Unit, a Delayed Coking Unit, and a Solvent Dewaxing Unit, have been added to improve production and quality. The refinery, accredited with ISO-9002, ISO-14001, ISO-114064, and OHSAS, uses eco-friendly hydrofinishing technology and adheres to Total Productive Maintenance (TPM).

In 2002, the Digboi Centenary Museum was established to celebrate 100 years of the refinery. The museum complex includes the famous well No. 1, where it all began in 1889, and the Digboi Centenary Park, developed to preserve the ecological balance.

Digboi offers various tourist attractions, including the oil refinery site, the museum, the oil fields, and the Centenary Park. The town also hosts a war cemetery constructed by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission to honor World War II heroes and an 18-hole golf course where major tournaments are held.

The Digboi refinery is committed to environmental protection and conservation, ensuring the sustainability of natural resources for future generations. It has revitalized its operations to continue serving the nation in the new millennium. The historic achievements of the Digboi refinery and the dedication of its workers over 119 years remain unmatched.
