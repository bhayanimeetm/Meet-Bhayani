            <p align="justify" style="font-size: 1.1rem;">The country's most beautiful region is the Northeast, adorned with a rich variety. The beautiful forests, rivers, and mountains support a huge variety of flora and fauna. Beautiful ethnicities, the beauty of the Himalaya, undulating terrains, green tea gardens, excellent wildlife and bird sanctuaries, old temples, colorful festival crowds, scintillating folk music, and enchanting dances make this region one of great beauty. One of the very well-known northeastern states, Assam is the land of the blue hills, having majestic rivers Brahmaputra and Barak, one-horned rhinoceros, crude oil, tea gardens, and other natural resources.</p>

            <p align="justify" style="font-size: 1.1rem;">The small town of Digboi, one of India's most important oil towns, is located at the extreme eastern end of Assam. It lies hemmed in on one side by the Upper Dehing Reserve Forest and serves as a springboard to the Arunachal Pradesh districts in the southeast.</p>
            
            <p align="justify" style="font-size: 1.1rem;">Situated in Tinsukia district, Assam, Digboi is considered the birthplace when crude oil was found in the late 19th century. It got its nickname- the oil city of Assam. It hosts the first oil well in Asia, dug in the year 1889, and the first refinery, set up in 1901.</p>
            
            <p align="justify" style="font-size: 1.1rem;">This town has good infrastructure and typical bungalows; it used to house hundreds of British professionals working for the Assam Oil Company well into India's independence. This town also has an eighteen-hole golf course at the Digboi Club and Italian-type architect guest houses and tourist apartments in town as part of the initiative to attract tourism in the Upper Part of Assam. The company is now a part of the Indian Oil Company Limited, displaying its charging red rhino logo as a token of its full-throttle capacity.</p>
            
            <p align="justify" style="font-size: 1.1rem;">It is just within seven years of the world's first oil well being drilled by Edwin L. Drake in Titusville, Pennsylvania, in 1859 that history sees another mammoth oil exploration in Asia. It is said that oil was in use in the ancient times of ancient Egypt, Persia, India, and Mesopotamia. Mid 19th century found Scottish chemist, Dr. James Young, in the process of producing lamp and heating oil from coal and oil shale, later known as paraffin oil, so he became known as "Paraffin Young." Edwin L. Drake took the credit as the first American to strike oil, opened the gates for a rush of investment and drilling which created petroleum as a major industry; he was considered the father of the petroleum industry although he was not able to patent his methods of drilling.</p>
            
            <p align="justify" style="font-size: 1.1rem;">It was in Upper Assam's thick, malaria-riddled jungles that a group of prospectors chanced upon oil while laying down a railway line for the Assam Railways and Trading Company in 1867. The town derived its name from an English engineer's constant exhortation to workers: "Dig, boy, dig," when they were drilling for oil.</p>
            
            <p align="justify" style="font-size: 1.1rem;">Thus, it was at Digboi in 1890 that the first well was drilled, which marked the beginnings of the oil industry in India. The Digboi refinery started functioning in 1901, and marketing of petroleum products on a more organized scale was initiated in 1902. In the days of World War II, which was perhaps its peak production time, the Digboi oil field produced almost 7,000 barrels of oil per day. It now produces about 240 barrels per day, making it the longest operating oil field in India.</p>
            
            <p align="justify" style="font-size: 1.1rem;">The company has a vast marketing network of 351 retail outlets, 399 SKO/LDO agencies, and 268 LPG distributorships that are serviced by terminals in Tinsukia and Lumding. In addition, the company provides transfers to states like West Bengal, Orissa, Bihar, Jharkhand, Haryana, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh, and Punjab.</p>
            
            <p align="justify" style="font-size: 1.1rem;">The second well, at Makum, was again dry but silted, like the first. Thereon began the rise of the modern town of Digboi, the present headquarter of the Assam Oil Division of the Indian Oil Company Limited, dating back to the rich and long history of 1825 when mention of an early reference of the discovery of oil in Upper Assam was traced in the reports of several British officers and the Geological Survey of India.</p>
            
            <p align="justify" style="font-size: 1.1rem;">The Digboi refinery, originally 0.5 MMTPA, was modernized and expanded to 0.65 MMTPA in 1996. Units have also been added in the production process for Catalytic Reformer, Delayed Coking, Solvent Dewaxing, etc., to upgrade production and quality. This ISO-9002, ISO-14001, ISO-114064, and OHSAS accredited refinery works with eco-friendly hydro-finishing technology and follows Total Productive Maintenance in accordance with international norms.</p>
            
            <p align="justify" style="font-size: 1.1rem;">The Digboi Centenary Museum was set up in 2002 to celebrate 100 years of the establishment of the refinery. It is set amidst a museum complex that includes the famous well No. 1, from where it started back in 1889, and the Digboi Centenary Park, developed for the purpose of the maintenance of ecological balance.</p>
            
            <p align="justify" style="font-size: 1.1rem;">Some of the important places of interest which Digboi has in store for the tourists are the site of the oil refinery, the museum, oil fields, and Centenary Park. Among other places of interest, there exists in the town a war cemetery built up by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission for paying homage to its heroes during World War II. The town also houses an 18-hole golf course, with major tournaments being held here.</p>
            
            <p align="justify" style="font-size: 1.1rem;">The Digboi Refinery is committed to the preservation and protection of the environment so that the resources of the planet are conserved for the future of its generations. The refinery reinvented itself to serve the nation in this new millennium. There is no comparison to the historic achievements of the Digboi Refinery and the commitment of its workers over a period of more than a century and a decade.</p>
